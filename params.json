Its intention is to provide real world guidance that can be applied immeidately in a non-threatinging way. \r\n\r\n##Goals\r\n\r\nOften with security and privacy concerns there exist trade-offs with usability and complexity. The most secure user is often the one who doesn't use the Internet, but if you would like to climb out from under your rock to join the rest of us on the Internet, this guide is here to help you. Getting to a point where you can be reasonably confident in your personal security and privacy online can take a some effort, due diligence, and technical vigilance, but you'll find it achievable.\r\n\r\n##Advice\r\n\r\nAll of the items in this guide can be overwhelming. Don't treat these items as hard and fast rules to tackle all at once, rather over time do your best to improve your overall personal security and privacy by implementing and trying out more of these practices. Once you have tried many of them out, you can then decide for yourself what your security and privacy needs are compared to the relative inconvenience and acceptance for the listed threats.\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you are a computer or security expert, or if you see things that could be improved as you implement these practices in your day to day life please let us know by submitting a github issue to the project.\r\n\r\n##The Security Best Practices Guide\r\nhttps://github.com/SecurityInnovation/Security-Best-Practices/wiki\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
